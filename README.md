**A description of the project and its functionality**    
  
This project showcases different people, their hobby or job, and places they've been to.
A user can edit the main info items of the page via popup forms - edit the profile owner information and add or delete featured places.
Form validation functionality was added to this latest version, as well as active popup modal close using mouse click outside form or pressing escape key on keyboard.
  
**A description of the technologies and techniques used**  

In this project I've implemented adaptive and responsive techniques such as relative values for element sizing. Popup forms were created and javascript used to control the form and its input. Emphasize was put on working with arrays and manipulating the DOM.
Form validation was coded with javascript while disabling built-in browser validation.
